# work_scripts
Scripts I use for work.

This repo is full of a smattering of scripts I've culled from the Internet as I've needed them.  They cover a variety 
of purposes, and are written in several languages.  My hope is to clean these up.  Convert to one language (PowerShell)
where relevant, make them more generic, and test them to confirm they actually work.  I hope to grow this repo as my
career progresses, and continue to improve what's in here.
